# 1049. Last Stone Weight II
# Topics: 'Array', 'Dynamic Programming'
# Level: 'Medium'

# You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

# We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

#     If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
#     If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.

# At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

# Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
# we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
# we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
# we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.

# Example 2:

# Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]
# Output: 5

 

# Constraints:

#     1 <= stones.length <= 30
#     1 <= stones[i] <= 100
