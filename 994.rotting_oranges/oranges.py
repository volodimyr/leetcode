# 994. Rotting oranges
# Topics: 'Array', 'Breadth-First Search', 'Matrix'
# Level: 'Medium'

# You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

#     0 representing an empty cell,
#     1 representing a fresh orange, or
#     2 representing a rotten orange.

# Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

# Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
# Output: 4

# Example 2:

# Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

# Example 3:

# Input: grid = [[0,2]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

 

# Constraints:

#     m == grid.length
#     n == grid[i].length
#     1 <= m, n <= 10
#     grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
