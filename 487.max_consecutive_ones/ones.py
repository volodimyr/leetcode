# Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most one 0.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0]

# Output: 4

# Explanation:

#     If we flip the first zero, nums becomes [1,1,1,1,0] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
#     If we flip the second zero, nums becomes [1,0,1,1,1] and we have 3 consecutive ones.
#     The max number of consecutive ones is 4.


# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]

# Output: 4

# Explanation:

#     If we flip the first zero, nums becomes [1,1,1,1,0,1] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
#     If we flip the second zero, nums becomes [1,0,1,1,1,1] and we have 4 consecutive ones.
#     The max number of consecutive ones is 4.

# Constraints:

#     1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
#     nums[i] is either 0 or 1.


# Follow up: What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream? In other words,
# you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too large to hold in memory.
# Could you solve it efficiently?
