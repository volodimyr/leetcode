# 1095. Find mountain array
# Topics: 'Array', 'Binary Search'
# Level: 'Medium'

# (This problem is an interactive problem.)

# You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

#     arr.length >= 3
#     There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
#         arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
#         arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]

# Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1.

# You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:

#     MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
#     MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.

# Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: mountainArr = [1,2,3,4,5,3,1], target = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 exists in the array, at index=2 and index=5. Return the minimum index, which is 2.

# Example 2:

# Input: mountainArr = [0,1,2,4,2,1], target = 3
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 3 does not exist in the array, so we return -1.

 

# Constraints:

#     3 <= mountainArr.length() <= 104
#     0 <= target <= 109
#     0 <= mountainArr.get(index) <= 109
