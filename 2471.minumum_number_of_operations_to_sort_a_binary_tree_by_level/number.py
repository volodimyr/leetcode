# 2471. Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level
# Topics: 'Tree', 'Breadth-First Search', 'Binary Tree'
# LeveL: 'Medium'

# You are given the root of a binary tree with unique values.

# In one operation, you can choose any two nodes at the same level and swap their values.

# Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each level sorted in a strictly increasing order.

# The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: root = [1,4,3,7,6,8,5,null,null,null,null,9,null,10]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# - Swap 4 and 3. The 2nd level becomes [3,4].
# - Swap 7 and 5. The 3rd level becomes [5,6,8,7].
# - Swap 8 and 7. The 3rd level becomes [5,6,7,8].
# We used 3 operations so return 3.
# It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [1,3,2,7,6,5,4]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# - Swap 3 and 2. The 2nd level becomes [2,3].
# - Swap 7 and 4. The 3rd level becomes [4,6,5,7].
# - Swap 6 and 5. The 3rd level becomes [4,5,6,7].
# We used 3 operations so return 3.
# It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.

# Example 3:

# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Each level is already sorted in increasing order so return 0.

 

# Constraints:

#     The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
#     1 <= Node.val <= 105
#     All the values of the tree are unique.
